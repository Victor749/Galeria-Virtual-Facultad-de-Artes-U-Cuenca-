# `TourAppTemplate`

`TourAppTemplate` is a sample app code template for a tour like app with React360.
There're also inline comments to guide how each part of the sample code works.
This Template includes:
- Basic UI and interaction and Animation
- Loading Data via network
- Display 360 scene and hotspots
This sample is designed for use in Facebook Instant Games using the [Instant Games SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/instant-games)."

`TourAppTemplate` provide two example ways to place hotspots, which you can switch by setting 
`useDynamicSurface` to true/false in `index.html`
1. Use dynamic surface: (`useDynamicSurface = true`):
   - This is recommended for most case, it has less limitation and allow you to place hotspots on any position(e.g. on the top or bottom). From performance wise, less than 8 hotspots per scene should works fine on mobile.
   - Each hotspot will be rendered on a different surface, and surface will be place on the right position dynamically by the hotspot setting.
   - You don't need to care about the creating, destroying, placing the surface. TourHotspot uses a custom native view "WorkInProgressSurface", which allow you to create and rotate a surface from react side by using this view.
   - "RCTWorkInProgressSurface" provides a custom native view to create a surface and place it in 3D space from react side.
2. Use one cylinder surface: (`useDynamicSurface = false`)
   - If all of you hotspots are in the place that a cylinder surface can cover, and you want simpler layout logic of hotspots that just maps position from 2D space of cylinder layer to the world. You can try this way.
   - It has two limitation: 1. You can't place a hotspot outside of the edge of the cylinder surface, otherwise it will be cropped. 2. There's an edge of cylinder surface on the back, if a hotspot is placed across the edge, it will also get cropped. (This template solves this by placing tooltip of a hotspot on the left if it's close to right edge).
   - It uses the translation on X direction on cylinder layer space to map hotspots' rotation to 3D space.
   - If you want to go with this way, you can remove the `RCTWorkInProgressSurface` and `WorkInProgressSurface` related codes.
